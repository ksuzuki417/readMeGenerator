  #Description
  I wanted to create a README generator. I built this project because if I can create a README file quickly, I can spend more time on the actual project. This project will assist building ReadMe file by simply answering questions. I learned to use CLI application. node is required in order to use this application. I also learned how to install npm and its dependencies. I've created several questions to build the description section of the ReadME file. Just simply answering these questions will generate a description of the project.
  

  ##Installation
  This is a CLI application. You will need to save this file in order to use it.

  ##Usage
  Simply, answer the questions one by one when you are ready to create a ReadME file. When you complete the questions, it will create a ReadME file dynamically.

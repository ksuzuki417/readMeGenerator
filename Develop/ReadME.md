  ## Description
  I needed a good ReadME for my project. I built this project because if I can create a README file quickly, I can spend more time on the actual project. This project will assist building ReadMe file by simply answering questions. As I worked on this project, I learned how to use CLI application such as node  I also learned how to install npm and its dependencies such as inquirer, and util. I've created several questions to build the description section of the ReadME file. Just simply answering these questions will generate a description of the project.
  

  ## Installation 
  This is a CLI application. You will need to save this file in order to use it.

  ## Usage
  Simply, run node index.js and answer the questions one by one when you are ready to create a ReadME file. When you complete the questions,a ReadME Markdown is created dynamically!

  ## Description
  I needed a good ReadME for my project. I built this project because if I can create a ReadME file quickly, I can spend more time on the actual project. This project will assist building README file by simply answerting questions. As I worked on this project, I learned how to install npm and its dependencies such as inquirer, and util. Also how to format a ReadME file. There are several questions built just to complete the description section of the ReadME. Simply just answering these questions will generate a good description of your project.
  

  ## Installation 
  This is a CLI application. You will need to save this file in order to use it.

  ## Usage
  Simply, run node index.js and answer the questions one by one when you are ready to create a ReadME file. When you complete answering the questions, a ReadME MD is created dynamically!
